Genesis Foundation Child Theme
===

This child theme is made for Genesis and uses all Zurb's Foundation 5 super powers.

Master branch gives you a pre-compiled theme ready to use, and also all the tools you need to configure your own js and css files(gulp and codekit).

Specific [`gulp`](https://github.com/g-kanoufi/genesis-foundation-child-theme/tree/gulp) and [`codekit`](https://github.com/g-kanoufi/genesis-foundation-child-theme/tree/codekit) versions are also available.

In any case, you can use it as is by cloning/downloading the .zip file.

* All bases functionalities from Genesis can be used. Just note that Primary and Secondary menu are changed to top-left and top-right.
* This child theme comes with a lot of ready to use common Genesis functions, check the `lib` folder.
* This is totally open source, so feel free to use/change as you wish.
* Licensed under GPLv2.

How to use
---------------

Nothing is more easy, download .zip or clone this repository, add it to your themes folder or upload it(only a .zip file) from your website adminstration panel and you are ready to go.

If you want to use it with gulp, just run `bower install && npm install` to install all dependencies, then just run `gulp`.
A `gulp build` task is also prepacked giving you your optimized theme in a ready to upload .zip file

Prefer codekit, easy, just run `bower install` and you are good to go.

Included is a dummy-content.xml file if you ever need some content, it's actually taken from Genesis base child Theme.


You are now ready to go! 

Enjoy!
